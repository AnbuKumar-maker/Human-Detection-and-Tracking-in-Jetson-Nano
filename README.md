# Human-Detection-and-Tracking-in-Jetson-Nano
The project focuses on a real-time robust human detection and tracking system for video surveillance that can be used in varying situations. The system consist of two parts first human detection and secondly tracking. Early research is biased to human recognition rather than tracking. Monitoring the movements of human being raised the need for tracking. Monitoring movements are of high interest in determining the activities of a person and knowing the attention of person. This project focuses on Person Detection and tracking. The tracking algorithm used here is Kalman Filtering. The Kalman Filter has long been regarded as the optimal solution to many tracking and data prediction tasks. Its use in the analysis of visual motion. The purpose of Filtering is to extract the required information from a signal, ignoring everything else. In this project the Kalman Filter is fed with the velocity, position and direction of the person which helps it to predict the future location of the Person based on his previous data.
